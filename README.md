## What is it?

To help our fellow lockdown-captives, we had been tasked with the very special assignment to make a mini-game site to grant some fun to them!

We could either make one big game or each make one minigame. We all decided on making a minigame each.




## Our Way of working:

* Pitching ideas using Trello
    * take note of different ideas
    * adding color palettes and styles so we all know which direction we take
* Teamwork
    * daily check ins to see how everyone is doing
    * helping each other via screenshare and calls
* Cohesiveness
    * deciding on style and color palette, using hexadecimal color codes so everyone is on the same page
